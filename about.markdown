Hi I'm Lennart Keller and I work as a research assisitant at the chair of Computerphilologie at the JMU WÃ¼rzburg. Also I'm a Master's Student in Digital Humanities.

While I was a undergraduate I was very lucky to get the oppurtunities to work on a variety of fields as a student assitant.

Including:

* basic (shallow) machine learning (mostly with text data)
* active learning
* (extreme) multilabel classification
* developing web applications
* organize and transform XML data, using a wild bunch of x-technologies
* metaphore annotation in german literature
* teaching and creating tutorials for Digital Humanities lectures

Currently my main interests (and goals) are:

* learning more on state of the art deep learning and nlp techniques
* applying them on literary texts
* also I am very interested into gaining insights on the pitfalls and limitations when working with artificial intelligence on real world data
* since i also studied political science and sociology as an undergraduate I sometimes wonder how one could apply nlp in these areas
